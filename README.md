# youBlog

The project attempts to create a Blogging System using Java, frameworks like Spring framework.
Among other technologies I will be exploring are but not limited to
1 .Thymeleaf views, JPA and MySQL,Hibernate etc.
Parts of this application is based on a series of tutorials i found on the net as part of my learning.
2. A functioning Blog we should be able to register a user
3. Login and log out
4. As auser we should read all posts, basically CRUD operations
5. The bigger plan is to develop this Blogging system into a fully funtioning systems which i always dreamedof having..One day (:
